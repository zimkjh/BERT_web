Many scholars see Banquo as a foil and a contrast to Macbeth . Macbeth , for example , eagerly accepts the Three Witches ' prophecy as true and seeks to help it along . Banquo , on the other hand , doubts the prophecies and the intentions of these seemingly evil creatures . Whereas Macbeth places his hope in the prediction that he will be king , Banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction . Banquo steadily resists the temptations of evil within the play , praying to heaven for help , while Macbeth seeks darkness , and prays that evil powers will aid him . This is visible in act two ; after Banquo sees Duncan to bed , he says : `` There 's husbandry in heaven , / Their candles are all out '' . This premonition of the coming darkness in association with Macbeth 's murders is repeated just before Banquo is killed : `` it will be rain to - night '' , Banquo tells his son Fleance .
