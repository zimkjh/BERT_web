Film adaptations have approached Banquo 's character in a variety of ways . Akira Kurosawa 's 1957 adaptation Throne of Blood makes the character into Capitan Miki ( played by Minoru Chiaki ) , slain by Macbeth 's equivalent ( Captain Washizu ) when his wife explains that she is with child . News of Miki 's death does not reach Washizu until after he has seen the ghost in the banquet scene . In Roman Polanski 's 1971 adaptation , Banquo is played by acclaimed stage actor Martin Shaw , in a style reminiscent of earlier stage performances . Polanski 's version also emphasises Banquo 's objection to Macbeth 's ascendency by showing him remaining silent as the other thanes around him hail Macbeth as king . in the 1990 telling of Macbeth in a New York Mafia crime family setting , Men of Respect , the character of Banquo is named `` Bankie Como '' and played by American actor Dennis Farina .
