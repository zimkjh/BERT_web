The concept of a character being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall is not unique to Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar 's feast episode of the Bible . The term ' ghost at the feast ' has entered popular culture , and is often used as a metaphor for a subject a person would rather avoid considering , or ( considering the general plot of Macbeth ) a reminder of a person 's unpleasant past or likely future .
