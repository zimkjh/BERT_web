Banquo 's role , especially in the banquet ghost scene , has been subject to a variety of interpretations and mediums . Shakespeare 's text states : `` Enter Ghost of Banquo , and sits in Macbeth 's place . '' Several television versions have altered this slightly , having Banquo appear suddenly in the chair , rather than walking onstage and into it . Special effects and camera tricks also allow producers to make the ghost disappear and reappear , highlighting the fact that only Macbeth can see it .
