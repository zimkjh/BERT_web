Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films . Principal photography began in Vancouver on June 26 , under the working title Love Machine . Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film . At the end of June , Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film . The next month , T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film , and that `` it 's not going to be the same movie in a different location ( like The Hangover Part II ) . It 's got different stakes , different things happen , some pretty tragic , dark shit happens in the first part of the film , in the beginning , and the rest of the film is kind of dealing with that . '' By then , Kapii had been working with Leitch on the set , and expected to continue contributing to Colossus through to April 2018 .
