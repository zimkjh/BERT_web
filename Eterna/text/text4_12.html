Banquo 's other appearance as a ghost during the banquet scene serves as an indicator of Macbeth 's conscience returning to plague his thoughts . Banquo 's triumph over death appears symbolically , insofar as he literally takes Macbeth 's seat during the feast . Shocked , Macbeth uses words appropriate to the metaphor of usurpation , describing Banquo as `` crowned '' with wounds . The spirit drains Macbeth 's manhood along with the blood from his cheeks ; as soon as Banquo 's form vanishes , Macbeth announces : `` Why , so ; being gone , / I am a man again . ''
