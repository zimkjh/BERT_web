When Macbeth returns to the witches later in the play , they show him an apparition of the murdered Banquo , along with eight of his descendants . The scene carries deep significance : King James , on the throne when Macbeth was written , was believed to be separated from Banquo by nine generations . What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James ' right to the throne by lineage , and for audiences of Shakespeare 's day , a very real fulfilment of the witches ' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne . This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth , who not only wants the throne for himself , but also desires to father a line of kings .
