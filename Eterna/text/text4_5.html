Banquo 's role in the coup that follows the murder is harder to explain . Banquo 's loyalty to Macbeth , rather than Malcolm , after Duncan 's death makes him a passive accomplice in the coup : Malcolm , as Prince of Cumberland , is the rightful heir to the throne and Macbeth a usurper . Daniel Amneus argued that Macbeth as it survives is a revision of an earlier play , in which Duncan granted Macbeth not only the title of Thane of Cawdor , but the `` greater honor '' of Prince of Cumberland ( i.e. heir to the throne of Scotland ) . Banquo 's silence may be a survival from the posited earlier play , in which Macbeth was the legitimate successor to Duncan .
