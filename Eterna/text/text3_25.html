By November 2016 , with development underway on Deadpool 2 , Fox was also planning Deadpool 3 , which was said to include the team X-Force . With the confirmation that Leitch would direct Deadpool 2 , it was revealed that Fox was looking for a separate filmmaker to direct Deadpool 3 . In March 2017 , Reese clarified that though Deadpool 2 sets - up the X-Force team , a future film focused on the team would be separate from Deadpool 3 , `` so I think we 'll be able to take two paths . ( X-Force ) is where we 're launching something bigger , but then ( Deadpool 3 is ) where we 're contracting and staying personal and small . '' After the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017 , Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney , and that the company would be willing to make future R - rated Deadpool films `` as long as we let the audiences know what 's coming '' .
