Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from Holinshed 's Chronicles , a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587 . In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king , rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth . Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James , who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo . Critics often interpret Banquo 's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth , resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it . Sometimes , however , his motives are unclear , and some critics question his purity . He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king , even though he has reason to believe Macbeth is responsible .
