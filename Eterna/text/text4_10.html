Macbeth eventually sees that Banquo can no longer be trusted to aid him in his evil , and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne . Thus he has him murdered . Banquo 's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force , in this case to Macbeth 's impending death . His spirit lives on in Fleance , his son , and in his ghostly presence at the banquet .
