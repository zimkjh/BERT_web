Banquo is in a third of the play 's scenes , as both a human and a ghost . As significant as he is to the plot , he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross , a Scottish nobleman who survives the play . In the second scene of the play , King Duncan describes the manner in which Macbeth , Thane of Glamis , and Banquo , Thane of Lochaber , bravely led his army against invaders , fighting side by side . In the next scene , Banquo and Macbeth , returning from the battle together , encounter the Three Witches , who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor , and then king . Banquo , sceptical of the witches , challenges them to predict his own future , and they foretell that Banquo will never himself take the throne , but will beget a line of kings . Banquo remains sceptical after the encounter , wondering aloud if evil can ever speak the truth . He warns Macbeth that evil will offer men a small , hopeful truth only to catch them in a deadly trap .
