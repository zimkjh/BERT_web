Scholars debate whether Macbeth 's vision of Banquo is real or a hallucination . Macbeth had already seen a hallucination before murdering Duncan : a knife hovering in the air . Several performances of the play have even ignored the stage direction to have the Ghost of Banquo enter at all , heightening the sense that Macbeth is growing mad , since the audience can not see what he claims to see . Scholars opposing this view claim that while the dagger is unusual , ghosts of murdered victims are more believable , having a basis in the audience 's superstitions . Spirits in other Shakespeare plays -- notably Hamlet and Midsummer Night 's Dream -- exist in ambiguous forms , occasionally even calling into question their own presence .
