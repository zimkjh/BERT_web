On August 14 , stunt woman Joi `` SJ '' Harris died in a motorcycle accident after losing control and crashing into Shaw Tower . Harris , the first African - American female professional road racer , was working on the film as a stunt performer for the first time and had only joined the production a week before . Harris was not wearing a helmet because the character she was portraying , Domino , does not wear one in the scene , and there had not been time since she joined the film to create one for her to fit underneath the Domino wig . She had two full days of rehearsing the stunt as well as five more attempts on the day of the accident . Veteran stunt double Melissa Stubbs had been available and willing to do the stunt , but the inexperienced Harris was preferred due to her skin color being a match for Beetz . This decision was criticized by multiple stunt professionals , with many noting that Harris ' experiences racing motorcycles did not necessarily qualify her as an able stunt performer . Production on the film was shut down immediately after the incident
