When Macbeth kills the king and takes the throne , Banquo -- the only one aware of this encounter with the witches -- reserves judgment for God . He is unsure whether Macbeth committed regicide to gain the throne , but muses in a soliloquy that `` I fear / Thou play'dst most foully for ' t '' . He offers his respects to the new King Macbeth and pledges loyalty . Later , worried that Banquo 's descendants and not his own will rule Scotland , Macbeth sends two men , and then a Third Murderer , to kill Banquo and his son Fleance . During the melee , Banquo holds off the assailants so that Fleance can escape , but is himself killed . The ghost of Banquo later returns to haunt Macbeth at the banquet in Act Three , Scene Four . A terrified Macbeth sees him , while the apparition is invisible to his guests . He appears again to Macbeth in a vision granted by the Three Witches , wherein Macbeth sees a long line of kings descended from Banquo .
