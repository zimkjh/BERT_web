Like the vision of Banquo 's lineage , the banquet scene has also been the subject of criticism . Critics have questioned whether not one , but perhaps two ghosts appear in this scene : Banquo and Duncan . Scholars arguing that Duncan attends the banquet state that Macbeth 's lines to the Ghost could apply equally well to the slain king . `` Thou canst not say I did it '' , for example , can mean that Macbeth is not the man who actually killed Banquo , or it can mean that Duncan , who was asleep when Macbeth killed him , can not claim to have seen his killer . To add to the confusion , some lines Macbeth directs to the ghost , such as `` Thy bones are marrowless '' , can not rightly be said of Banquo , who has only recently died .
