Midway through the 1931 season , the Frankford Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and ceased operations . After more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement , the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by Bert Bell and Lud Wray and awarded them the franchise rights of the failed Yellow Jackets organization . The Bell - Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 ( equal to $40,230 today ) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises . Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the National Recovery Administration -- the centerpiece of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal -- Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles . Neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same , citing the aforementioned period of dormancy . Furthermore , almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles ' first roster . The Eagles , along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the now - defunct Cincinnati Reds , joined the NFL as expansion teams .
