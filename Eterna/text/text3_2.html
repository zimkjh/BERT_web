Plans for a sequel to Deadpool began before that film 's release , and were confirmed in February 2016 . Though the original creative team of Reynolds , Reese , Wernick , and director Tim Miller were quickly set to return for the second film , Miller left the project in October 2016 due to creative differences with Reynolds , and was soon replaced by Leitch .
