Stage directors , unaided by post-production effects and camera tricks , have used other methods to depict the ghost . In the late 19th century , elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed a wide variety of approaches for this task . In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image ; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear in the middle of the scene , and then again from the midst of the audience . In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo 's spirit . In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play ( Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry ) ; he used Macbeth 's shadow as the ghost . In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play , with an African - American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo .
